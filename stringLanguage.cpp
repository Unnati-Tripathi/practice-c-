//Chef wants to implement wildcard pattern matching supporting only the wildcard '?'.
// The wildcard character '?' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching.
// He has two strings X and Y of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '?'.
// He wants to know whether the strings X and Y can be matched or not.



//                            MEANING
// either x[i]==y[i]
// or
// x[i]!=y[i] then ek ko wildcard ghoshit kr dijiye...:)
